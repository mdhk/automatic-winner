title: Questions about Git with some answers
---

- What is the difference between a branch and a fork?

- How does a branch name differ from a tag? What are the differences when using them to reference a commit? Are there semantic differences in their use?

- What does it mean to rewrite history?
I don't know

- Is deleting stuff considered fine or is it a bit dodgy?

- If stuff is no longer being "pointed at" do you find them with their hash? What does the hash actually summarize/hash/represent? What does it mean for the hash to be unique?
